# Pig-Game

Pig is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die. You win by being the first player to score 50 or more points.

## Rules
A player rolls a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn. If the player rolls a 1 the turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.
